      <h4> Delphinium</h4>
      <p>One commonly thinks of delphinium plants as having true blue flowers, which is the most common color.
         But numerous hybrids are available in shades of pink, lavender, red, white and yellow. Blooms may be single or double. 
         Delphinium planting is normally at the back of the bed, where flower spikes can reach 2 to 6 feet (.6-2 m.) tall.
          Delphinium flowers are often planted in masses or groups. Shorter varieties are useful in other areas of the garden. 
      </p>
      <h4> How to Grow Delphinium </h4>
      <p> Delphinium plants in a sunny area with soil that is consistently moist. Don’t let them dry out.
        Mulch helps retain moisture and keeps roots cool. Performance of this specimen is enhanced when growing delphinium plants 
        in neutral to slightly alkaline soil pH. Soil should be well-draining. Care of delphinium should include regular fertilization 
        in spring when the plant begins to grow, and during the flowering period.
         Work in well-composted organic material such as rotted cow manure, or use a basic 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. 
         Yellowing foliage or stunted growth often indicates the plant needs more fertilizer.

      <h4>Anemone</h4>
      <p>The common name "anemone" is a collective label used for a number of different species in the Anemone genus of plants.
         Many gardeners know the plants as windflowers, so named because the delicate poppy-like flowers sway in the lightest breezes.
          (The Greek word anemos translates as "wind.") The various species vary considerably in size,
           but all have basal leaf clumps from which long flower stems arise to support delicate flowers, 2 to 5 inches in diameter.
            Flower colors also vary depending on species and variety. The flowers are usually simple single blossoms,
             though some varieties do feature double flowers,similar to a frilly, oversized mum. 
        They are fast-growing plants that will flower in their first season. Life expectancy depends on species;
         some are relatively short-lived while others can live for decades.
        All parts of anemone plants are moderately toxic to humans if large quantities are eaten and mildly toxic to pets.
        12 The plants contain protoanemonin, an oily substance that can cause serious stomach upset as well as skin irritation.
      </p>
      <h4>Anemone care</h4>
      <p>Choose your planting time based on the blooming cycle of your chosen species. Plant spring bloomers in the fall, 
         and fall bloomers in the spring. Different species of anemones have different types of root structures, and the
          planting method varies a bit from type to type. Normally, 
          anemones are planted from corms or bare roots purchased from online or mail-order retailers.

        Some species, such as A. coronaria (often known as poppy anemone) have roots that resemble bulb-like corms.
         The small corms are planted in groups, like tulips or daffodils. Place them in clusters,
          spaced about 1 inch apart and 2 inches deep. Let nature dictate the spreading of the cluster. 
          With corm-types, leave the foliage in place to replenish the corms until it turns brown.
        
        Other species, including A. hupehensis (sometimes known as Japanese windflower),
         have tuberous or rhizomatous roots that are planted like dahlia or tuberous iris roots, 
         in small groups about 3 to 6 inches deep.
        
        Be generous when you plant the petite spring anemones;
         these low-growing plants that range from 3 to 15 inches in height look best when planted in groups of 50 or more.
          Whatever the species of Anemone, these plants generally like at least four hours of sun each day and well-drained soil that is relatively moist.
           Once planted, they are relatively carefree plants. Those types with rhizomatous roots will need to be lifted and divided every three years or so.</p>

      <h4>Narcissus</h4>
      <p>Most species are perennials and emerge from bulbs in the spring.
         The flattened leaves arise from the base of the plant and range in height from 5 cm (2 inches) to 1.2 metres (4 feet),
          depending on the species. The central crown of each yellow, white, or pink flowers ranges in shape from the form of a trumpet,
           as in the daffodil, to a ringlike cup, as in the poet’s narcissus. Some species hybridize in the wild,
            and many horticultural crosses between species have resulted in attractive garden hybrids.

      </p>
    <h4> Care </h4>
<p>Grow in average, well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade (see individual species for specific requirements). 
   In autumn, plant bulbs from 1.5 to 5 times the bulbs' height (3 inches or more in cold climates).
   Under glass, grow in 1 part grit and 2 parts soil mix. Deadhead seed heads (except those of species, 
   for dispersal) and allow leaves to photosynthesize for 6 weeks before cutting back, including plantings in turf.
    Lift and divide clumps if they become overcrowded or perform poorly. Bulbs may be forced in autumn in a cold frame;
     plant with tops visible, keep moist, and when rooted, move to a cool greenhouse (less than 64°F).
