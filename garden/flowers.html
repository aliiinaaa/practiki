      <h4> Delphinium</h4>
      <p>One commonly thinks of delphinium plants as having true blue flowers, which is the most common color.
         But numerous hybrids are available in shades of pink, lavender, red, white and yellow. Blooms may be single or double. 
         Delphinium planting is normally at the back of the bed, where flower spikes can reach 2 to 6 feet (.6-2 m.) tall.
          Delphinium flowers are often planted in masses or groups. Shorter varieties are useful in other areas of the garden.

      <h4>Anemone</h4>
      <p>The common name "anemone" is a collective label used for a number of different species in the Anemone genus of plants.
         Many gardeners know the plants as windflowers, so named because the delicate poppy-like flowers sway in the lightest breezes.
          (The Greek word anemos translates as "wind.") The various species vary considerably in size,
           but all have basal leaf clumps from which long flower stems arise to support delicate flowers, 2 to 5 inches in diameter.
            Flower colors also vary depending on species and variety. The flowers are usually simple single blossoms,
             though some varieties do feature double flowers,similar to a frilly, oversized mum. 
        They are fast-growing plants that will flower in their first season. Life expectancy depends on species;
         some are relatively short-lived while others can live for decades.
        All parts of anemone plants are moderately toxic to humans if large quantities are eaten and mildly toxic to pets.
        12 The plants contain protoanemonin, an oily substance that can cause serious stomach upset as well as skin irritation.

      <h4>Narcissus</h4>
      <p>Most species are perennials and emerge from bulbs in the spring.
         The flattened leaves arise from the base of the plant and range in height from 5 cm (2 inches) to 1.2 metres (4 feet),
          depending on the species. The central crown of each yellow, white, or pink flowers ranges in shape from the form of a trumpet,
           as in the daffodil, to a ringlike cup, as in the poetâ€™s narcissus. Some species hybridize in the wild,
            and many horticultural crosses between species have resulted in attractive garden hybrids.
